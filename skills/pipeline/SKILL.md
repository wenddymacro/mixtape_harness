# /pipeline — Run the official pipeline and verdict every exhibit

A narrow skill. It does ONE thing: run the single official pipeline
command, read the report it produces, and tell the researcher plainly
what is confirmed, what was inaccurate, and what is not covered.

## Convention (what makes this skill portable across projects)

The master pipeline file is ALWAYS `code/run_pipeline.sh` at
the project root. That naming convention is the skill's only project
knowledge — same name in every GTD project, so this skill works anywhere
without configuration.

The file's contract: it fingerprints (SHA-256) every tracked artifact,
runs every official step from raw data, fingerprints again, and writes a
report to `audits/pipeline_runs/run_<stamp>.json` with a per-artifact
verdict:

- **confirmed** — byte-identical before and after: reproduced, not just fresh
- **changed** — the pipeline now produces something different: the prior
  version was inaccurate
- **missing** — existed before, not produced now: orphan
- **untouched** — on disk but no official step rewrote it: its generator
  is not in the pipeline (mtime unchanged, so identical bytes prove nothing)
- **new / regenerated / regenerated-identical** — bookkeeping for new
  artifacts and figures

If `code/run_pipeline.sh` does not exist in this project,
STOP and say so. Offer to create one following the reference
implementation in one of your existing projects, but do not
improvise: the researcher decides what counts as official.

## Steps

0. **Tell the user how long it will take, before running.** Read the
   newest report in `audits/pipeline_runs/` and quote its
   `total_seconds`: "The last full run took 1m 5s — expect about that."
   If no report exists, say this is the first run and the duration is
   unknown.

1. **Run it** (from the project root):

   ```
   bash code/run_pipeline.sh
   ```

2. **Read the report** it just wrote — the newest file in
   `audits/pipeline_runs/`.

3. **Report back in plain language**, in this order:

   - **Steps**: did all stages run clean? If a stage failed, quote its log
     tail and STOP — nothing downstream of a failed stage is official, and
     the failure is the finding.
   - **CHANGED artifacts** (if any): these were inaccurate until this run.
     Name each file; if one feeds the manuscript or a deck, say so.
   - **MISSING artifacts** (if any): recommend cite-or-retire per artifact.
   - **UNTOUCHED artifacts** (if any): for each, identify its generator
     (grep the filename in code/ and scripts/) and ask the user whether to
     add that generator to the pipeline's `STEPS` list or retire the
     exhibit. Do not decide yourself — what counts as official is the
     researcher's call.
   - **Confirmed counts**: tables byte-identical, figures regenerated
     identical.

4. **The dashboard updates itself.** It reads the newest run report on
   every page load. Tell the user to refresh the browser; do not restart
   the server, do not edit the dashboard.

5. **If a sample-flow drift alarm was firing before the run**: the run
   wrote a new checkpoint, which acknowledges the current data state.
   Confirm in your report that the acknowledgment was intentional.

## What this skill must NOT do

- Do not edit any analysis script to "make the pipeline pass." A red
  verdict is information, never an inconvenience.
- Do not run individual stages selectively and call the result official.
  Official means the whole chain from raw data.
- Do not interpret results or update insights/hypotheses — that is
  analysis work, outside this skill's scope.
